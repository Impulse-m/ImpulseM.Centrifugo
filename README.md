# ImpulseM.Centrifugo

ImpulseM fork of [Centrifugo](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifugo): upstream Centrifugo v6 plus features needed at messenger scale. The features are implemented from the public [Centrifugo PRO documentation](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/pro/overview), keeping its config keys and API shapes. Planned work is tracked in the [roadmap](https://github.com/Impulse-m/ImpulseM.Centrifugo/issues/17).

## Added on top of upstream

* [Server-side publication tags filter](https://github.com/Impulse-m/ImpulseM.Centrifugo/issues/7): a per-subscriber filter set by the backend (subscription token, connection token `subs`, subscribe and connect proxy) that the client can't widen.
* [User blocking and token revocation](https://github.com/Impulse-m/ImpulseM.Centrifugo/issues/10):
  * `block_user`, `unblock_user`, `revoke_token` and `invalidate_user_tokens` server API methods;
  * extensions for session-based revocation and revocation generations;
  * an in-memory store on every node, live disconnects and cluster propagation.
  * Differences from Centrifugo PRO:
    * `revoke_token` without `user` triggers a full sweep of local connections, coalesced and run in the background. Pass `user` for a targeted, cheap disconnect.
    * `expire_at` in the past is rejected with bad request.
    * Extensions: `user` and `revoked_at` on `revoke_token`; `generation` and `revoked_at` on `invalidate_user_tokens`; `token_revoke.uid_claim` and `user_tokens_invalidate.generation_claim` config; disconnect code 4500 for blocked users; loop guard disconnects with 3500.
  * Not implemented:
    * subscription tokens are not covered by revocation, only connection tokens;
    * `invalidate_user_tokens.channel` is not available;
    * `storage_type` is memory only: `redis` and `database` are rejected at startup. Use the per-node revocation source (`access_revoke.source`) as the durable delivery path.
* Singleflight for `History`, `Presence` and `PresenceStats` (`singleflight.enabled`): concurrent identical calls share one broker or presence request. Helps only with a remote engine (Redis), not with the memory engine.
* `shared_position_sync` channel option (namespace or `channel.without_namespace`): the node checks stream position once per channel per `client.channel_position_check_delay` instead of once per subscriber, so position checks cost one broker request per channel per interval.
  * Requires `force_positioning`, `allow_positioning`, `force_recovery` or `allow_recovery`, and a `client.channel_position_check_delay` greater than zero.
  * Detection latency: one to two `client.channel_position_check_delay` intervals for a node-wide loss, one interval for a single client.
  * `client.channel_position_check_delay` must exceed the broker's worst-case PUB/SUB lag, otherwise a publication in flight is reported as a loss.
  * Options are applied when a channel's first subscriber arrives on the node. A config change applies to a channel after it empties.
  * Enabling it for the first time (no channel used it at startup) requires a node restart: when no channel options use it, the node skips the per-publication lookup entirely.
* Operation rate limits (`client.rate_limit`) as described in the PRO docs: per-connection `client_command` limits with `total`, `default`, channel namespace overrides and RPC method overrides, `user_command` limits per user ID (in memory, shared by all connections of a user, including user-level `connect`), and `client_error` limits that disconnect abusive connections. `redis_user_command` is coming.

### Access revocation event source

Each node can receive access revocation events from a replayable log and rebuild its store after a restart. Kafka is the only source type now. Without `access_revoke.source.type` nothing changes.

```json
"access_revoke": {
  "source": {
    "type": "kafka",
    "window": "30m",
    "startup_timeout": "60s",
    "lag_threshold": "30s",
    "reject_connect_on_lag": false,
    "kafka": {
      "brokers": ["kafka:9092"],
      "topic": "access_revoke",
      "method_header": "centrifugo-method"
    }
  }
}
```

A record carries the API method name in the `centrifugo-method` header (`block_user`, `unblock_user`, `revoke_token` or `invalidate_user_tokens`) and the JSON request body of that API command, for example `{"user":"42","expire_at":1790000000}` with `block_user`. One producer can feed both the API and the source.

* Time defaults come from the record timestamp. Set `revoked_at` and `issued_before` in the payload when the producer may lag behind the real revocation.
* Events older than `window` are not replayed after a restart. Longer bans must be re-emitted or set by the token issuer.
* A node is ready once it caught up with the topic, or after `startup_timeout` (fail-open). The health endpoint answers 503 with `{"ready":false}` until then. With `reject_connect_on_lag: true` new connections are rejected while lagging. If all nodes lag, that is a cluster-wide outage.

Topic guidance:

* `cleanup.policy=delete`, not compact: compaction would collapse several events of one user.
* Retention of at least 2 × `window`.
* Record key is the user ID, so events of one user stay ordered.
* 1 to 6 partitions: every node reads every partition.
* Restrict producers with topic ACLs: any producer can ban users.

### Not implemented (yet)

* Map subscriptions.
* Redis and PostgreSQL persistence for revocation.
* `user_connections` API.
* Redis replica offloading.
* Sharded PUB/SUB.
* Per-namespace engines.
* Custom controllers.

Some of these are on the [roadmap](https://github.com/Impulse-m/ImpulseM.Centrifugo/issues/17).

## Install

Docker images are published to GitHub Container Registry for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/impulse-m/impulsem.centrifugo:1.0.0
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v "$(pwd)/config.json:/centrifugo/config.json" ghcr.io/impulse-m/impulsem.centrifugo:1.0.0
```

Image tags:
* `X.Y.Z`, `X.Y` and `latest` for releases;
* `master` and `sha-<commit>` for builds from the `master` branch.

Linux binaries are attached to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Impulse-m/ImpulseM.Centrifugo/releases).

## Versioning and releases

The fork uses its own semantic versioning starting at 1.0.0, independent of upstream version numbers. A release is made either by pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag or by running the `release` workflow manually with the version (without `v`). The workflow runs the tests, publishes the images, creates the tag and the GitHub Release.

## Client SDKs

* JavaScript (browser, Node.js, React Native): [ImpulseM.Centrifugo.Client.JS](https://github.com/Impulse-m/ImpulseM.Centrifugo.Client.JS), npm package `@impulsem/centrifuge`.

## Upstream Centrifugo

Centrifugo is an open-source scalable real-time messaging server. Centrifugo can instantly deliver messages to application online users connected over supported transports (WebSocket, HTTP-streaming, Server-Sent Events (aka EventSource), GRPC, WebTransport). Centrifugo has the concept of channel subscriptions – so it's a user-facing PUB/SUB server.

Centrifugo is language-agnostic and can be used to build chat apps, live comments, multiplayer games, real-time data visualizations, collaborative tools, etc. in combination with any backend. It is well suited for modern architectures and allows decoupling the business logic from the real-time transport layer.

Several official client SDKs for browser and mobile development wrap the bidirectional protocol. In addition, Centrifugo supports a unidirectional approach for simple use cases with no SDK dependency.

### Why Centrifugo

The core idea of Centrifugo is simple – it's a PUB/SUB server on top of modern real-time transports:

The hard part is to make this concept production-ready, efficient, flexible and available from different application environments. Centrifugo is a mature solution that already helped many projects with adding real-time features and scale towards many concurrent connections. Centrifugo provides a set of features not available in other open-source solutions in the area:

* Efficient real-time transports: WebSocket, HTTP-streaming, Server-Sent Events, GRPC, WebTransport
* Built-in scalability with Redis (or Redis Cluster, or Redis-compatible storage – ex. AWS Elasticache, Valkey, KeyDB, DragonflyDB, etc), or Nats.
* Simple HTTP and GRPC server API to communicate with Centrifugo from the app backend
* Asynchronous PostgreSQL and Kafka consumers to support transactional outbox and CDC patterns
* Flexible connection authentication mechanisms: JWT and proxy-like (via request from Centrifugo to the backend)
* Channel subscription multiplexing over a single connection
* Different types of subscriptions: client-side and server-side
* Various channel permission strategies, channel namespace concept
* Hot message history in channels, with automatic message recovery upon reconnect, cache recovery mode (deliver latest publication immediately upon subscription)
* Delta compression in channels based on Fossil algorithm
* Online channel presence information, with join/leave notifications
* A way to send RPC calls to the backend over the real-time connection
* Strict and effective client protocol wrapped by several official SDKs
* JSON and binary Protobuf message transfer, with optimized serialization and built-in batching
* Beautiful embedded admin web UI
* Great observability with lots of Prometheus metrics exposed and official Grafana dashboard
